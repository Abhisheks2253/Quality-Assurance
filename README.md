# Quality-Assurance
Course projects for IE 508: Quality Assurance

## Mini-project 1 – Measurement System Analysis

This group project tested the understanding of a Gage Linearity Study. The ultimate goal was to determine the types of bias present in measuring the flight time of a self-made ‘Paper Helicopter’ using by devising a standard measurement system for same. Before moving to our actual product – the paper helicopter, we dropped a ‘penny’ from 5 different heights (marked on wall) and measured the flight time using the stopwatch. Based on the data collected, estimate the sample size, conduct a Gage linearity Study and identified-quantified the variation and Bias that exists in this system. Making appropriate changes to this system, we conduct the same experiment to standardize our measurement system. 

## Mini-project 2 – Quality Tools 

In this project, we explore the Tools of Quality by applying them to identify the root cause and the improvement opportunities to a process – We considered the process of ‘Monitoring the Variation in Blood Sugar Levels of a Type-2 Diabetic’ 
We start of by making a process flow-chart and collecting the relevant data – We reached out to a patient and retrieved the ‘historical data of blood sugar levels before and after Breakfast-lunch-dinner’ from the patient’s ‘Glucometer’. Histograms were used to analyze the variation in observations over time and determine if the values are within desired range, Individual (I) and Moving Range (MR) charts were used to monitor the process mean and variation for continuous observations – Before/After Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner. We also leveraged the fishbone diagram, brainstorming and 5Whys techniques to better understand defects/issues in said process. We came up with an improved process flow and check-sheet to better monitor the blood sugar levels.

## Mini project 3 – Process Control

For the purpose of this project, we chose the process of measuring the hardness of household tap water at different times and determine the stability of filtration process at source of this water using appropriate process control chart. We took 4 readings, by measuring a fixed volume of water from a continuous running tap, at different times during the day. Since the data collected was continuous with sub-group size 4, we used the Xbar-R chart in Minitab to analyze the process stability based on CpK values and determined the need to identify further special-cause variation in said process.
